This file contains a report about bug fixes and new features
in Tar plugin for Open Salamander. Plus sign means new
feature addition, minus sign means a bug fix.

version 3.0: (?/?/2001)
  -fixed doubled backslash added to a target path, causing problems
   on some network drives (reported by J.Patera)
  -fixed nasty bug causing miss of eof in some archives, thus resulting
   in unlimited growth of extracted file (reported by J.Patera)
  -fixed invalid reading of file names in some tar archives
   in old gnu format
  -fixed missing overwrite confirmation when extracting
   a file from compressed archive (no tar)
  -fixed crash with corrupted gzip archives
  +added support for incremental tar archives

version 3.10: (3/3/2004-05/05/2004) J. Patera
  -fixed extraction of zero-length files
  +supported invalid TAR files ending exactly after data of last file
   (i.e. without padding to block boundary and an empty block)
  -when extracting subdir with "name", files with "name.ext" on the same
   level no longer extracted as well
  -empty directories now also get extracted
  -fixed GNUTYPE_LONGNAME ('L') links
  -compress-ed files with odd max bit-length not rejected as invalid
  -no more complains about corrupted data on compress-ed files containing
    CLEAR codes with certain max bit-lengths (e.g. 9 or 12, but not 16)

version 3.11: (02/06/2004-30/06/2004) J. Patera
  -don't complain about premature EOF if unpacked data less than 6 bytes
  -e_Binary detected only if unpacked size >= 26 (was internal error)
  -random rubbish fname if path starts with ".." and goes above the
   subtree stored in the TAR file

version 3.20: (24/11/2004) J.Patera
  +support of BZIP2-compressed RPM packages

version 3.21: (28/04/2005) J.Patera
  +dummy implementation of LZH decoder saying it is not yet supported (bug #223)
  -(packed) TARs used to be refused if w/o terminating block (bug #183)

version 3.22: (23/01/2006) J.Patera

  -GZIP: if original file name contains Unix path
   (e.g. /var/mailman/archives/private/grass5/2005-July.txt), only the real
   file name part is taken. The file would be unextractable otherwise
